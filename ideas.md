# Hackathon Ideas

This is list of ideas for hackathon, feel free to choose one or come up with your own.

## Finance

* Uniswap for NEAR to fungible tokens (see for fungible token standard - http://github.com/nearprotocol/neps/pull/21).
* Basic insurance on chain: for example ensure Bitcoin price within some bounds (e.g. a derivative), have a market of offers and supplier of insurnace. Oracle that would provide the source of truth for resolving the event.

## Gaming

* Rock-paper-scissors based game to figth monsters or other players. The character is an upgradable NFT that improves over time as battles are carried out.

## Social

* Business card: send users a business card that has QR code they can claim NFT with. This can include paper cards as well.
* Moloch DAO: implement a DAO based on Moloch game design (https://molochdao.com/)
* Wechat Mini app: login with NEAR and exchange NFTs with other users in the group.
* NFT for attending meetup: QR code for meetup organizers that allows attendees to scan and claim the specific NFT of the specific event.
* Marketplace for meetup organizers and speakers. Organizers can create an event and offer slots for speakers. Speakers either use auction mechanic or offer to speak and have attendees vote for who to listen to.
* Maskbook like plugin:use the API of those social products already have and expand the influence of blockchain by their network. Educate people why privacy matters and what blockchain can do.

## Enterprise

NEAR has support for enterprise applications via private shard.
Main idea behind private shard is that a company can run their own shard, preserving privacy of the data on it while still communicating with applications on public chain and other private shards.
Compared to regular consortium chains, this doesn't require big buy in as just requires to spin up shard by given company first and already get benefits.

The ideas here are all about possible contracts that can interact between public and private shards.

* Education: a private shard maintains grades and attendance for students, public shard contains different applications that can leverage this information. For example scholarship that is given out on a regular basis based on the grades.
* Supply chain: across two private shards, passing information about components of the bigger item while maintaining proof of the components origin.

## Other

* Food ordering: three party marketplace on the blockchain, which connects restaurats, delivery and users. As food is ordered from specific resturant, delivery can pick up order on this marketplace.
* Tracking packages: the supplier posts upgrades encrypted by public key of the user, only given user can decrypt and check the status.
* Video sharing: currently many centralized services are starting to block content about blockchain. This service can store video content on IPFS or similar file storage solution and use NEAR for discovery, payments and ownership.
* event tickets: limited number of tickets, and can set rules for trade activities. cause in China, the ticket resell is a nightmare.
